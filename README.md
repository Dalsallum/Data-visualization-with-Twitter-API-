# Data-visualization-with-Twitter-API-
A simple Data visualization  using Python and seaborn with data acquired from Twitter API .

By using Python and Seaborn I decided to apply what I learned so far in a real Data from Twitter API, I compare between 2 famous restaurants and who did better in 2020.
One file is to get the data from the API and save the result as CSV.
The other file to prepare the data and visualize it.
